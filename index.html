                Introduction
              </header>
              <p>
                <b>What is Gender-based Violence?</b>
                Gender-based violence (GBV) is violence that is directed at an individual based on his or
                 her biological sex OR gender identity. It includes physical, sexual, verbal, emotional,
                  and psychological abuse, threats, coercion, and economic or educational deprivation, 
                  whether occurring in public or private life.
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Why do we talk about GBV?</b>
                Gender-based violence is an issue faced by people all over the world. Women are disproportionately 
                harmed by gender-based violence. That is why hundreds of organizations focus on ending violence 
                against women. According to the United Nation’s Population Fund, 1 in 3 women have experienced 
                physical or sexualized violence in their lifetime. That is not including emotional, financial, 
                or verbal abuse. Despite being so prevalent, gender-based violence is largely under reported 
                because of stigma and lack of access to resources and support systems.

                Violence Against Women
              </header>
              <p>
                The United Nations defines violence against women as "any act of gender-based violence that
                 results in, or is likely to result in, physical, sexual, or mental harm or suffering to women,
                  including threats of such acts, coercion or arbitrary deprivation of liberty, whether occurring 
                  in public or in private life." (1)
              </p>
              <p>
                <b>Intimate partner violence</b> refers to behaviour by an intimate partner or ex-partner that causes
                 physical, sexual or psychological harm, including physical aggression, sexual coercion, 
                 psychological abuse and controlling behaviours.
              </p>
              <p>
                <code>Sexual violence</code> is "any sexual act, attempt to obtain a sexual act, or other act directed against a 
                person’s sexuality using coercion, by any person regardless of their relationship to the victim,
                 in any setting. It includes rape, defined as the physically forced or otherwise coerced penetration
                  of the vulva or anus with a penis, other body part or object."

                Key Facts
              </header>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                    Violence against women – particularly intimate partner violence and sexual violence –
                     is a major public health problem and a violation of women's human rights.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Global estimates published by WHO indicate that about 1 in 3 (35%) of women worldwide have
                     experienced either physical and/or sexual intimate partner violence or non-partner sexual 
                     violence in their lifetime.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Most of this violence is intimate partner violence. Worldwide, almost one third (30%) of
                     women who have been in a relationship report that they have experienced some form of physical 
                     and/or sexual violence by their intimate partner in their lifetime.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Globally, as many as 38% of murders of women are committed by a male intimate partner.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Violence can negatively affect women’s physical, mental, sexual, and reproductive health, 
                    and may increase the risk of acquiring HIV in some settings.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Men are more likely to perpetrate violence if they have low education, a history of child
                     maltreatment, exposure to domestic violence against their mothers, harmful use of alcohol, 
                     unequal gender norms including attitudes accepting of violence, and a sense of entitlement
                      over women.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Women are more likely to experience intimate partner violence if they have low education,
                     exposure to mothers being abused by a partner, abuse during childhood, 
                     and attitudes accepting violence, male privilege, and women’s subordinate status.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    There is evidence that advocacy and empowerment counselling interventions, as well as home 
                    visitation are promising in preventing or reducing intimate partner violence against women.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Situations of conflict, post conflict and displacement may exacerbate existing violence, such as
                     by intimate partners, as well as and non-partner sexual violence, and may also lead to new forms 
                     of violence against women.

                Intimate partner (physical, sexual and emotional) and sexual violence cause serious short- 
                and long-term physical, mental, sexual and reproductive health problems for women. 
                They also affect their children, and lead to high social and economic costs for women, 
                their families and societies. Such violence can:

              <ul>
                  <li>
                    Have fatal outcomes like homicide or suicide.

                  <li>
                    Lead to injuries, with 42% of women who experience intimate partner violence 
                    reporting an injury as a consequence of this violence.

                  <code>
                    Intimate partner violence in pregnancy also increases the likelihood of miscarriage, stillbirth, 
                    pre-term delivery and low birth weight babies. The same 2013 study showed that women who experienced 
                    intimate partner violence were 16% more likely to suffer a miscarriage and 41% more likely to have
                     a pre-term birth

                Children who grow up in families where there is violence may suffer a range of behavioural and 
                emotional disturbances. These can also be associated with perpetrating or experiencing violence later in life.
              </p>
              <code>
                intimate partner violence has also been associated with higher rates of infant and child mortality
                 and morbidity (through, for example diarrhoeal disease or malnutrition).

                To achieve lasting change, it is important to enact and enforce legislation and
                 develop and implement policies that promote gender equality by:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ending discrimination against women in marriage, divorce and custody laws
                </li>
                <li>
                    ending discrimination in inheritance laws and ownership of assets
                </li>
                <li>
                    improving women’s access to paid employment

                While preventing and responding to violence against women requires a multi-sectoral approach,
                 the health sector has an important role to play. The health sector can:

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Advocate to make violence against women unacceptable and for such violence to be 
                    addressed as a public health problem.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Prevent recurrence of violence through early identification of women and children who
                     are experiencing violence and providing appropriate referral and support
                </li>
                <li>
                    Promote egalitarian gender norms as part of life skills and comprehensive
                     sexuality education curricula taught to young people.

                At the World Health Assembly in May 2016, Member States endorsed a global plan of action on strengthening the
                 role of the health systems in addressing interpersonal violence, in particular against women and girls
                  and against children.

                    and supporting countries' efforts to document and measure this violence and its consequences,
                     including improving the methods for measuring violence against women in the context of monitoring 
                     for the Sustainable Development Goals. This is central to understanding the magnitude and nature
